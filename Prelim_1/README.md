### PRELIM 1
This GitHub directly contains all of the files, codes, and images associated with the prelim. There is a folder where code is stored for all of the problems, and a separate folder for Problems 1 and 2 that hold the files and images associated with each problem.

The main write-up for the prelim can be found at ``mlt239_prelim.pdf``, which contains all of the instructions for reproducing the work. There is also a word document version ``prelim.docx``.

### Problem 1 contents
Contains the excel file, ``prelim_v2.xlsx`` that contains all of the parameters and calculations used for this problem. Also contains a prism file ``Prelim problem 1.pzfx`` that was used to plot problem 1D. I've also included the wolfram alpha output that I used to solve for W2.

### Problem 2 contents
Contains all of the plots that are used to answer the questions in Problem 2, as well as a write-up that answers Problem 2A and 2B. See the main pdf doc for an embedded version of these.

### Code contents
This contains all of the julia scripts and functions used to answer the questions in this prelim. All of the code is associated with problem 2, and are named corresponding to the problem it was for, with the exception of ``Bistable.jl`` and ``bistablebifur.jl``, which are used in problem 2C for the bifurcation plot construction.
